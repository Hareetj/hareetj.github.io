## What did you do this week? ##
This week was spent preparing for the test. I went over all the past quizzes, past piazza summary posts, and all of the files on the schedule. I think next time I will find a group to study with. I realize that I need to take more notes during class time because most of the test questions came directly from in class assignments we did. In class, we learned more about const pointers and all the differences between them. 

## What's in my way? ##
Nothing major is in my way. Just have to balance interview prep with school work and actually having a social life. After I find an internship for the summer, I don't see the rest of the semester being too tough because I don't have much classwork. 

## What will you do next week ##
Now that hell week is over, the next week shouldn't be as hectic. Going to start working on the project for this class and also have to start my app for my iOS class. Also, since every project needs to have a seperate partner I am going to have post on one of those threads on piazza.

## Tip of the week ##
Make a to-do list and add to it whenever you get something new. At least for me, seeing a list of things I need to do motivates me to stop being lazy and actually do them. You can also have a list in a list, for example for the last test I made a list of what I needed to study for the tests.
