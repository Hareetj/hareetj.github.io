## What did you do this week? ##
This past week we talked more about the Life project and some more OOP principles like inheritance and virtual functions. I worked on the Life project with partner and have made good progress so far. Finished and turned in the beta for my iOS project, and now only the final release remains. I like the idea of a class building toward a big final project versus having many smaller and unrelated projects because at the end of the class you have a very complex system and you are able to put that project on your resume. Also, I feel like havign students build a working project from scratch is very good experience for working in industry.

## What's in my way? ##
Finishing up the life Project is the only major thing in my way. Once this project is completed, all I will have to worry abut in my classes will be my final tests, which will be pretty relaxing up until a week before the tests.

## What will you do next week ##
Next week I will finish the project with my partner and pack for going home. My other classes are all done with their last round of tests before finals, so the next couple of weeks will be less stressful.

This class has changed my view on computer science. Before when I read docs on a language I would just read what a function takes as its parameters and what it's supposed to return and close the doc. But now I find myself looking up how exactly the function does that operation, and I think that comes from us implementing a lot of the C++ standard library functions and containers.
