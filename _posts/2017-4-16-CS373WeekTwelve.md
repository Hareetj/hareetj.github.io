title: CS373 Week Twelve
---

## What did you do this past week? ##
Last week in class we started using java in class and talked about refactoring. The techniques used aren't very complicated, but actively using those techniques while coding to make sure that your code is well refactored may be a challenge. We also started to talk about dynamic binding in java, which while confusing at first started to make sense after seeing a couple of examples.

## What's in your way? ##
As the semester is coming to an end there are going to be a lot of exams coming up in all my classes. Also there is still a lot of work to be done on the project for this class, which is due this Thursday. I was thinking that we would have a little more time than the other phases so that we could polish the webssite and make it look really nice.

## What will you do next week? ##
Next week I am going to work a lot on the project for this class. My task for this phase is to complete the visualization and help around with other general tasks.

## What's my experience of the class? ##
The class is going well. We are starting to get more into Java which is a good refresher. We are continuing the trend of talking about general software engineering principles, like refactoring. I'm interested to see what the rest of the class material is going to cover.
