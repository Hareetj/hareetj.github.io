title: Week Nine

## What did you do this week? ##
We took a closer look at the vector container in C++. We implemented constructors and some other basic operators for the vector structure. I also finished up the allocator project with my partner. It was pretty cool to implement a heap, and the project really solidified my understanding of pointers.

## What's in my way? ##
Going to start working on the new project when it's assigned because this weekend is halloween and I probably won't get much work done. Other then that, its basically the same as the past weeks. Although I've heard that the next project assigned is supposed to be the hardest, so I'm interested to see what exactly the project is.

## What will you do next week ##
I'm going to spend a majority of my time next week working on my iOS app. The alpha release is due thursday and we don't have much done right now so my group is going to have to put in a lot of work if we want to make the deadline.

I need to start reviewing more for the quizzes. I haven't been doing too well on them recently, and so I need to change something that I'm doing. I never take notes in class so I might start doing that, along with coding up the examples we do in class and messing around with that code.
