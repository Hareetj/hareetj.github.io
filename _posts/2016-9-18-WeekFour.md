## What did you do this week? ##
This week was pretty normal. Found a partner for the Netflix project and started on that. Solidified my understanding of pointers, and actually did well on the quizzes. There was a guest speaker from Bloomberg which was interesting, but he talked a little too much about specifics of his company and not enough about how the class helped him in my opinion.

## What's in my way? ##
There is the career fair next Tuesday, and that's the major thing I'm worried about. Gotta add my internship from last summer to my resume and get my elevator pitch ready. Other then that I don't really have much else going on in my classes. I'm liking how this semester most of my projects are actually interesting versus having a lot of regular homework. It motivates me to get the projects done quickly and I actually enjoy completing them.

## What will you do next week ##
Just going to be working on Project 2 and my app for my IOS class. Now that we're a month in I have got my schedule for school work and for socializing down and I'm excited for the rest of the year.

The projects in the class are much more free-flowing in its requirements than any other class I have taken. Most other classes have very strict guidelines that you have to follow, but now it's like here's what you have to do good luck. The project specs change based on piazza posts which I find pretty cool, if we think that the project can be improved in any way there's a very real chance that professor Downing will take your suggestion, like he did for the pull requests for project 1.

## Tip of the week ##
Don't be scared to say something you think is stupid when you're pair programming. The whole point is to bounce ideas off each other and even if you don't understand how something works its better to just ask your partner and clear up the misunderstanding rather than going on and still being confused.
