title: CS373 Week Thirteen
---

## What did you do this past week? ##
This past week we had to turn the final phase of the project. It was good experience and I learned a lot about working in groups and managing a project. Our website turned out alright, I feel that if we were to start over on this project I would try and get better estimates for the workload for certain features of the website. Not estimating things correctly led to my group mismangaging our time and not being able to implement things we had planned on. In class we have been talking about refactoring and different patterns for doing that. The patterns are interesting and good to know.

## What's in your way? ##
Tests are coming up in two weeks for all my classes so I've got to start studying for those. Other than that my classes also have one more project left so I have to do those. 

## What will you do next week? ##
Next week I'm going to work on my presentation for this class. I'm also going to do my projects for my other classes. I am going to try and make our website look a bit cleaner before the presentation. Our group also still has to do the critique of the other group.

## What's my experience of the class? ##
The class is good. I'm learning a lot of different things about Java and refactoring that will be useful in the future. 

## Tip of the week ##
Here's a funny video on the turing completeness of powerpoint: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uNjxe8ShM-8.
