## What did you do this week? ##
This past week was pretty relaxing. No major assignments due or any tests. Spent most of my time between working on my project for iOS and the allocator project. This project has a very CS439 feel to it, and I'm not really sure if I like it. Still not sure when the projects related to Object Oriented principles are going to come into play, but maybe the next one? I don't mind having the projects being about general C++ knowledge, but since the class name is Object Oriented Programming it's a bit misleading. In class we are starting to talk about containers. 

## What's in my way? ##
Finishing up projects for all my classes is basically what the rest of my semester is going to look like. This is the only class where I have to worry about tests which is nice because I get to spend a majority of my time coding compared to past semesters where a lot of the class was dealing with theory. 

## What will you do next week ##
Next week I'm going finish up allocator and do some last minute prep before my microsoft interview. If I get that intership my life will become a lot easier because job search is one of my major priorities right now. Other than that I'm going to be doing the same old stuff.

## Tip of the week ##
If you want to try iOS development but have a windows, there's a way to run Mac OS on a virtual machine, follow the instructions on this link: https://techsviewer.com/how-to-install-mac-os-x-el-capitan-on-pc-on-virtualbox/.
