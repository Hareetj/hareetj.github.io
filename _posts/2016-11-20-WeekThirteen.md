## What did you do this week? ##
Last week I finished up the Life project with my partner. In terms of coding I thought the Darwin project was more involved, but this project took a lot more thought. It was a good project for applying and learning OOP principles. In class we talked a lot about virtual functions and dynamic binding, and the differences between C++ and java.

## What's in my way? ##
Next week is thanksgiving and so there is nothing major going on in my classes. I am going to go home and relax. The only thing is that there is the OOP final the thursday that we come back so I should probably spend some time studying for that. Other than that the semester is coming to an end and so all the classes are going to have final projects or tests.

## What will you do next week ##
There is an extra credit project released, and I want to finish it before I go back home because I probably won't get it done if I am at home. I also have to start preparing for my presentation in my iOS class. 

I really enjoy this class, even though it is tough. I learned a lot not only about C++ but coding in general. I like professor Downing's teaching style and I'm excited to take SWE next semester. I heard that after project two you work on a huge group project which is basically building a website, which sounds like a lot of fun.

## Tip of the week ##
Using your computer late at night is bad for your eyes and makes falling asleep more difficult. There's a program called f.lux that will change the color of your screen to be easier on your eyes and make falling asleep easier.
