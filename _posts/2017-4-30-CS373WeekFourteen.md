title: CS373 Week Fourteen
---

## What did you do this past week? ##
This past week we talked about more patterns. Specifically, we talked about Abstract Factory patterns, adapter patterns, and visitor patterns. These are all useful to know and they help make your code look much cleaner. My group also presented our project, and even though one of our group members didn't show up it went ok.

## What's in your way? ##
All of my tests/final are coming up since its the last week of school so those are the major things in my way. Other than that just starting to pack up all of my clothes and getting ready to go back home.

## What will you do next week? ##
Next week most of my time is going to spend studying for the test in this class an my security class. They're both on the same day which sucks but I have a lot of time to study until then. I also have an AI project due so I'll have to find time to work on that too.

## What's my experience of the class? ##
The class is going well. Now that the class is basically over I'm happy with how it turned out. I learned a lot throughout the project and a lot from the lectures as well. I liked the breadth of topics covered in the class because of the exposure to many new topics and tools I hadn't used before.

## Tip of the week ##
Here's a repo with interactive coding challenges for interview prep: https://github.com/donnemartin/interactive-coding-challenges.
