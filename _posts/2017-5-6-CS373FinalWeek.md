title: CS373 Final Week
---

I have learned a great deal throughout this class. We used tools for the projects that I didn't have much experience with before, and even though it was challenging to learn these at first I'm glad I did because I now know a full web development stack which is a useful skill not only for your own gain but also for recruiting. Also, if you've never learned python you will be well versed in at by the end of this class, and knowing more languages is always good. You also learn broader concepts, like database design, refactoring code, and even things outside of the technical aspect, like the agile methodology which is very hot in industry right now and interview tips. This class is probably one of the only classes at UT where the skills you learn will directly translate to work you do after college, which to me is a very appealing quality because I don't really see myself as a systems guy but our undergrad core curriculum contains a lot of that, which is good to know but I feel like the time could have been better spent taking classes like this. The projects do take time and there are daily quizzes which can be challenging sometimes, but the quizzes prepare you well for the test and the projects teach you so many new things. Overall, take this class if you want to learn a lot of new and cool things and want a badass project to put on your resume.
