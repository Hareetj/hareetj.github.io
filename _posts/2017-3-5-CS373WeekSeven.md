title: CS373 Week Seven
---

## What did you do this past week? ##
This past week I mostly studied for the test. It was all multiple choice which was surprising because when I took OOP the first test had only coding questions. I should have focused more on the readings and the notes for the whole class instead of fixating on knowing how to implement the main classes/functions we talked about in class. I'm going to be more prepared for the final and hopefully do better on that.

## What's in your way? ##
Nothing major is in my way. I found a group for this class which is a relief, and I'm excited to start working on the project. I'm going back home to California over Spring Break which is going to be fun and relaxing. I think I'm going to drop my government class and take it over the summer, it seems like it'll be a lot easier and less time consuming this way. I don't really enjoy that class and it kinda sucks that it's required for graduation.

## What will you do next week? ##
Next week I have two tests, in security and in AI, so I'm going to be busy studying for that. I don't have any other assignments or projects due so other than tests it is a pretty relaxed week.

## What's my experience of the class? ##
The class is going well as usual. I wish professor Downing would have given a little more information about the format of the tests, but I guess the topic review list was posted and I should have prioritized my studying topics in a better way.

## Tip of the week ##
