## What did you do this week? ##
This past week me and my partner finished up the Darwin project. We thought we were finished and compared our results for the 72x72 grid with the one posted by students on piazza and found that we were not dealing with a lot of edge cases corretly. Other than that I'd say the project went pretty smoothly. I had to miss class Friday for an interview, and it seems counterintuitive where professor Downing tells us to actively seek internships for the summer but then doesn't let us makeup the quiz or drop it if we have to leave class to go to an interview.

## What's in my way? ##
I just looked at the project spec for Project 5 and it seems pretty complicated. Going from having no projects dealing with inheritance and abstraction to a project that requires a lot of OOP concepts is definitely going to be difficult but it should be a good learning experience. Other than that the beta version of my iOS app is due next week as well. Also after we turn in project 5 I plan on starting a side project since I'm going to have a lot of free time.

## What will you do next week ##
Next week I hope to get an early start on the project by finding a partner pretty quickly. I'm also expecting to finally hear back from some companies about how my interviews went/any offers that I got, so that's exciting.
