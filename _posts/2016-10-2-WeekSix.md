title: Week Six
---

## What did you do this week? ##
This week talked about iterators and dove into some c++ specific concepts like friend methods. Iterators are a lot more complicated than what I first thought, they have a lot of intricacies to them. There was no project to work on so the week went by pretty easily.


## What's in my way? ##
There's an OOP test on Thursday that I need to start studying for. I also have some interviews/hacker rank challenges that I need to finish up this week. It's going to be busy compared to last week.
## What will you do next week ##
Next week I'm going to spend a majority of my time studying for the test. The classes leading up to the test have done a good job of preparing me for the material, I just need to look over everything again. Then at the end of the week after I'm done with everything I'm going down to Dallas for the TX/OU game.

The test should be interesting, I'm curious to see the format/difficulty of the test. It seems like a lot of people are taking this class along with algorithims which seems like a lot of work. I'm pretty happy that I took algorithims last year. 

## Tip of the week ##
Take advantage of the week before the test where you have no project due. Don't get complacent because you don't have something that you have to turnin, start studying for the test early. I relaxed the entire last week but now I realize that I probably should have been studying.
