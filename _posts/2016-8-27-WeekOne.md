## What did you do this week? ##

We started off the year in typical fashion with a Hello program written in C++. But what was different this time around was the level of detail given to each line of the program. On Friday, we picked apart some programs regarding unit testing and assertions. I got my Docker environment all ready to go and got this blog setup.

## What's in my way? ##
Nothing concrete, but I am excited to see what the first project will be. I don't really know anyone in the class, so finding partners will be somewhat of a challenge but I have time to figure that out.

## What will you do next week ##
Next week's schedule is dangerously blank, but I assume it'll follow the format of dissecting code and praying not to get called on during class. I plan on getting started on the project as soon as its available just to keep myself on top of everything so that when the larger projects get released I'm used to starting the projects early. 

I really enjoy professor Downings teaching style. There is no magic hand waving or making assumptions on what the code does; we go through it line by line for full comprehension. I was nervous about this class because of the supposedly difficult projects and my lack of experience with C++, but after the first two classes I'm not worried but excited. I know I'll be prepared for the projects. Another thing I liked was incorporating tools that we'll need when we get a job. Putting the time in now and getting familiar with the tools will pay off later. One interesting thing that professor Downing does is calling on people randomly to answer questions or explain the code. This is terrifying and effective because you have to always be paying attention and know what's going on.
