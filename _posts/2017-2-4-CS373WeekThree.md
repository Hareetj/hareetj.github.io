## What did you do this past week? ##
Last week I finished up the collatz project. Using hackerrank was a good idea because most of us will have to use it at some point for interviews. In class we talked more about python, like exceptions, and learned a little more about how the type system works in python. We also started talking about sets lists and tuples. 

## What's in your way? ##
Next week I have two projects due in my security and AI classes and I haven't started either so I gotta put a lot of time into that. Other than that theres just reading for all my classes. All of my tests are going to come up in the same week so I should probably start preparing for that too.

## What will you do next week? ##
Next week I'm going to be spending most of my time doing project for my other classes. If project 2 is released for this class I'll probably just look at the specs but not start working on it until next week.

## What's my experience of the class? ##
The class is going well. I wanted to get better at python and that was one of the main reasons for taking this class. I am learning a lot and I know I'm going to use these skills for work. I'm excited to work on the big group project because I've already done the first two projects in OOP.

## Tip of the week ##
Since one of the most important things for the summer is finding a job, here's a brief but good overview on the process: https://github.com/cassidoo/getting-a-gig.
