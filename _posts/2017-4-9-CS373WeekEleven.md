title: CS373 Week Eleven
---

## What did you do this past week? ##
This last week we talked a lot about SQL topics, like joins and queries. It's good to know how to do these things, but it feels like we moved a little fast on the topic, but that might just be me, because I've been struggling on the past few quizzes regarding SQL. Last week my group also worked on finishing the project. Unfortunately we couldn't finish all the requirements but we know what we need to do next time make sure that we don't make the same mistake.

## What's in your way? ##
There's nothing major in my way. With only around a month of school left there are only going to be 1 more round of tests and finals for my classes. I also still need to finish up my application for the 5 years masters program and plan out what classes I am going to take next semester. There are some intersting choices this time, like neural networks, so I'll need to find some other classes that interest me.

## What will you do next week? ##
Next week my group is going to meet to discuss the next phase of the project and to make sure that we actually start early on this one. I also have to finish up my AI and security projects, so next week is going to be kind of busy.

## What's my experience of the class? ##
The class is going well. I feel like we are rushing the SQL portion of the class, and that a lot of the time spent implementing the joins in python could have been used to go over SQL in more depth. It's still good that we're covering that topic. 

## Tip of the week ##
https://techcrunch.com/2017/04/07/google-deepmind-open-sources-sonnet-so-you-can-build-neural-networks-in-tensorflow-even-quicker/, neural networks is a hot new topic with a lot of work being done regarding it, so it's pretty cool that UT is offering a class about it.
