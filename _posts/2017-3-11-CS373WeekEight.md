title: CS373 Week Eight
---

## What did you do this past week? ##
Last week I had two tests both on thursday so I was busy studying for that. They both went pretty well, a lot better than I was expecting. In this class we talked more about the project and what the requirements will be. I'm excited to learn all the tools that will be required to finish this project. We also talked about decorators in python, which are very powerful.

## What's in your way? ##
Nothing really is in my way right now. I'm not going to have any tests for a while and so for the next month or so I will be busy with projects in all my classes. After hearing about tensorflow in the GCP talk and seeing the website they made that guesses your doodles, I'm really interested in learning more about it and maybe even trying a project with it.

## What will you do next week? ##
Next week is spring break so the priority is going to be relaxing and doing nothing. When I go home I'm going to try and meet all my friends that are also home on break, and catch up on sleep. Other than that, I have SWE and AI projects due the week when I get back so I should probably work on those during the break. 

## What's my experience of the class? ##
The class is going well. It was cool that professor Downing brought in actual engineers who use GCP/AWS to teach us how to set it up and use it. 

## Tip of the week ##
Here's a cool tutorial for making a reddit both with python: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krTUf7BpTc0
