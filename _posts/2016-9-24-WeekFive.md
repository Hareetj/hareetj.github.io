## What did you do this week? ##

Career fair was this week, and I thought it went well compared to past years. Got a couple of interviews, but I realize now that I should have talked to more companies instead of getting lazy near the end of the career fair. Also Netflix was due this week. The project itself wasn't too bad but once again there were many issues with TravisCi and generally a good amount of stress with turning in the project.

## What's in my way? ##
I have to start doing technical interview prep because I plan on applying to a lot more companies over the next few weeks. Other than recruiting, I don't have anything major in my way. I was thinking of starting a side project, but I'm going to give that more thought after I've found an internship for the summer.

## What will you do next week ##
There's a test in the class in two weeks, and I'll probably start studying for it. I also have a test in American Literature next Wednesday so I gotta prepare for that. Next week is going to be pretty relaxed overall.

First two projects haven't been too difficult. I think the next one is going to be pretty hard because it isn't due for a while. Hopefully it involves OOP because I know that there are a lot of interview questions regarding the subject and I want to refresh my knowledge on it.
