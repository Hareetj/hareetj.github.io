title: Week Three
---

## What did you do this week? ##
We only had two classes this week because of labor day, so that was nice. We talked about a lot of different topics from pointers and structs to c-strings and l/r values. I also finished up the project this week and got it ready for submission. I know that learning all of the tools will be useful in the future, but in the present moment it is pretty annoying to have to get everything to work right, and not having worked with a lot of these tools and having one small error make you lose 20% on the project is pretty stressful.


## What's in my way? ##
Project two is going to be released next week and so once again I'm going to try and start early so I don't get lazy and wait until the last minute. I am also still looking for a partner so if you're reading this and need one too let me know. I also need to start reviewing what we did in the class before to start doing better on the quizzes.

## What will you do next week ##
Nothing special happening next week. Rush is over so I'm not going to be busy with that, probably just work on the project like usual.

Been in class for two weeks and we haven't really talked about anything regarding Object Oriented Programming, but I'm ok with that because we are slowly building up towards it. It's important to have a good base understanding of the language before focusing only on OOP. A cool thing I noticed about picking on students to answer questions is that you actually get to have a one on one conversation with the teacher while being in class of 90 students.

## Tip of the week ##
Double and triple check all the project requirements before submitting because if anything is wrong you're going to lose 20%. The instructions were pretty clear on what files to submit, and I think from here on out all the stress that came with learning/getting the tools to work is going to shift into stress on actually completing the project.
