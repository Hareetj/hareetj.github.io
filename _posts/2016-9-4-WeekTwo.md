title: Week Two
---

## What did you do this week? ##

Most of this past week was spent talking about the project, Collatz.  I had to brush up on my vim skills after a summer of coding mainly in python, but I got back into the groove of things pretty quickly. In terms of coding difficulty it was relatively easy, but trying to learn all the tools and get them working was another story. I really liked how the project was structured, start with a dummy solution and optimize the code from there. We were also given hints in class on how to do smaller optimizations, but coding the optimization with the cache was done with no help. I also kept up with piazza this past week, and was surprised at how quickly professor Downing and the ta's responded to questions. It wasn't as necessary for this project, but when they get more complicated I'm sure the quick response time will be very helpful. At first I thought trying to get 15 issues on github was going to be a challenge, but using it as a todo list was helpful in organizing how I wanted to tackle the project. I thought it would take around 10 hours, but it took 15 just to set everything up and get a basic dummy solution working.

## What's in my way ##
Nothing major is coming up in the next week. My shedule in general is pretty relaxed, this is the only class where I have actual tests in. Every other class is either project or paper based, which is good because when it comes time to study for this class I won't have much stopping me.

## What will I do next week ##
In the next week I'm going to wrap up on the project by adding unit test cases and creating the JSON file for submitting. I also might try and get the runtime down 0.00 seconds, but that would be more related to my pride than anything else. I also have dance team tryouts next wednesday/thursday and other rush events, so it's going to be pretty busy.

## My Experience ##
Week two of the class, and this is probably the only class I've taken at UT where I can sit through the whole lecture and actually be engaged for every minute of it. Professor Downing's teaching style facilitates this by the random picking on students, but it's also the fact that all of the information taught seems really useful not just for the class but also for full-time work.

## Tip of the week ##
I had forgotten most of how to use vim from when I took 439, but http://www.openvim.com/ is a great tool to run through all the basics.
