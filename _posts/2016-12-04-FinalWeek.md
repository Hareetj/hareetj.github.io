## Overall experience of the class ##
This class, although difficult, was very rewarding. It was much more of a c++ class than an OOP class but after going through the entire class I think actually prefer to have it that way. I learned much more than I have in any of my other CS classes here at UT so far. The lectures were the best part of the class, being very organized and to the point in every class. I felt like I learned something new and useful everyday in class. The policy of randomly calling on students helps keep the class engaged and focused. I struggled on the daily quizzes somewhat but they were good for reinforcing the lecture material. I enjoyed doing the projects, and learned a lot of from them. They weren't too challenging and we were given ample time to finish them. The tools used for the projects although a bit tedious were useful to learn. There were two tests in the class, and they were pretty difficult. It was hard to study for the tests because you're given a list of topics and that's about it. A little more guidance about what the test would entail and some more suggestions on how to study would be helpful. Overall I learned a lot during the course and would definitely recommend this class to everyone!
